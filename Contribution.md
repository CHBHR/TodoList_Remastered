to the pdf here [a link](https://github.com/CHBHR/TodoList_Remastered/blob/main/documentation/Documentation%20tech.pdf)

IF a new feature is implemented, a use case diagram should explain how it works in a simple
way and be added to the doc file here [a link](https://github.com/CHBHR/TodoList_Remastered/tree/main/documentation/Diagrammes)
