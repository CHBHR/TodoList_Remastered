# TodoList_Remastered

Projet 8 pour le parcours "DÃ©veloppeur PHP / Symfony" - openclassroom

A to do list web application to manage your tasks.

Registered users can create, edit and delete tasks on a board to get organized. 
Tasks can have a deadline and can be toggled as "done".

Admin users can create, edit or delete users and Orphan tasks.

The tasks of a deleted user will become "Orphan tasks", that then can only be accessed by admins.

## Old branch

This project was a reboot within an up to date version of PHP / Symfony of the old todolist project.

The old project repository can be consulted here:
https://github.com/CHBHR/TodoList

Because of the amount of issues and bugs while migrating this project, the old and confusing code architecture and the time spent on updating, I decided to transfer all the functionnalities to anew project.
Thus saving on developpement time, maintainability and better execution management.

All the information on the developpement can be found here:
